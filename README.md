## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.13+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), and a free Gemini API key from
[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tertiarycourses/TGS-2024042961-Develop-Multi-AI-Agent-Applications-with-Gemini-Agent-ADK.git
cd TGS-2024042961-Develop-Multi-AI-Agent-Applications-with-Gemini-Agent-ADK/labs
uv sync
```

Create a `.env` file in the `labs/` folder:

```env
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=0
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your-openweather-key   # optional, tool labs
TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-key             # optional, search labs
```

> **Never commit your `.env` file or API keys.** It is git-ignored in this repository.

Run any agent:

```bash
uv run adk run <agent_folder>   # terminal chat
uv run adk web                  # browser IDE at http://localhost:8000
```

## Core ADK Patterns

**Define an agent**

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent

root_agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    name='root_agent',
    description='A helpful assistant for user questions.',
    instruction='Answer clearly and concisely.',
)
```

**Add a tool** — the docstring and type hints are the contract the model reads.

```python
def get_weather(city: str) -> dict:
    """Retrieves the current weather for a specified city.

    Args:
        city (str): The name of the city.

    Returns:
        dict: status and result or error msg.
    """
    return {"status": "success", "report": "..."}

agent = Agent(..., tools=[get_weather])
```

**Multi-agent handoff**

```python
root_agent = Agent(
    name='root_agent',
    sub_agents=[math_tutor_agent, physics_tutor_agent, history_tutor_agent],
    instruction='Route each question to the right specialist.',
)
```

**Sequential workflow**

```python
from google.adk.agents import SequentialAgent

workflow = SequentialAgent(
    name='workflow_agent',
    sub_agents=[input_agent, research_agent, report_agent],
)
```

**Guardrail** — return `None` to allow, an `LlmResponse` to block.

```python
def block_keyword_guardrail(callback_context, llm_request):
    if "BLOCK" in last_user_message.upper():
        return LlmResponse(content=types.Content(
            role="model", parts=[types.Part(text="I cannot process this request.")]))
    return None

agent = Agent(..., before_model_callback=block_keyword_guardrail)
```

**Structured output** — note an agent with `output_schema` cannot also use tools.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Recipe(BaseModel):
    title: str
    ingredients: list[str]
    cooking_time: int

agent = Agent(..., output_schema=Recipe)
```
