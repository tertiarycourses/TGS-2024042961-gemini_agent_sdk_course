# Lab 11 — Structured Output — Forcing Valid JSON with Pydantic

**Topic 02:** Build A Multi Agent App with Gemini ADK  
**Learning outcome:** LO3 — produce machine-readable agent output for downstream systems.  
**Tools:** google-adk, Pydantic BaseModel, output_schema

## Goal

Attach a Pydantic output_schema so the agent returns a validated Recipe object with typed fields instead of free-form prose that a downstream system cannot parse.

## What you'll build

lab11 — an agent whose every reply is schema-valid JSON.

## Setup

Run every command from the `labs/` folder (the parent of this one), so that
the shared virtual environment and the single `.env` are picked up.

```bash
cd ..            # into labs/ if you are inside this lab folder
uv sync          # once per machine — installs google-adk and all deps
cp .env.example .env   # once — then paste your GOOGLE_API_KEY into .env
```

Then run this lab with either:

```bash
uv run adk run lab11     # terminal chat
uv run adk web              # browser IDE, then pick lab11 at http://localhost:8000
```

## Step-by-step

1. Read the Recipe model and the output_schema argument

   ```bash
   cat lab11/agent.py
   ```

2. Note the typed fields: title, ingredients, cooking_time, servings, instructions
3. Run the agent

   ```bash
   uv run adk run lab11
   ```

4. Request a recipe

   ```bash
   Chicken rice
   ```

5. Confirm the reply is JSON with all five fields and correct types
6. Add a difficulty field to the Recipe model

   ```bash
   difficulty: str
   ```

7. Re-run and confirm the new field appears in the output
8. Note the ADK restriction that an agent with output_schema cannot also use tools

## Test it

Every response parses as JSON matching the Recipe schema, cooking_time is an integer, and your added difficulty field is populated.
