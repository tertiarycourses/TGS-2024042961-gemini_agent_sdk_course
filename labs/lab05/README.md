# Lab 5 — Give an Agent Memory — Sessions, State and the Runner

**Topic 02:** Build A Multi Agent App with Gemini ADK  
**Learning outcome:** LO3 — implement session management so an agent remembers earlier turns.  
**Tools:** google-adk, Runner, InMemorySessionService, google.genai types

## Goal

Drive an agent programmatically with a Runner and an InMemorySessionService, so the conversation persists across turns instead of restarting on every message.

## What you'll build

lab05 — a multi-turn agent that answers follow-up questions using earlier context.

## Setup

Run every command from the `labs/` folder (the parent of this one), so that
the shared virtual environment and the single `.env` are picked up.

```bash
cd ..            # into labs/ if you are inside this lab folder
uv sync          # once per machine — installs google-adk and all deps
cp .env.example .env   # once — then paste your GOOGLE_API_KEY into .env
```

Then run this lab with either:

```bash
uv run adk run lab05     # terminal chat
uv run adk web              # browser IDE, then pick lab05 at http://localhost:8000
```

## Step-by-step

1. Read how the session service, session and Runner are wired together

   ```bash
   cat lab05/agent.py
   ```

2. Note the APP_NAME, USER_ID and SESSION_ID that identify one conversation
3. Run the session script

   ```bash
   uv run python lab05/agent.py
   ```

4. Ask an initial question that establishes context

   ```bash
   What is the weather in Tokyo?
   ```

5. Ask a follow-up that only works if the agent remembers

   ```bash
   And what about Osaka?
   ```

6. Comment out the session creation and re-run to observe the failure
7. Restore the session code and confirm continuity is back

## Test it

The follow-up 'And what about Osaka?' is understood as a weather question without repeating the word weather — and stops working when the session is removed.
