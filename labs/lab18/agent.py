"""Lab 18 — Capstone starter.

Design and build your own multi-agent application for a use case in your
industry. This file is a scaffold: replace the specialists and the tool with
your own, then run it with:

    uv run adk run lab18
    uv run adk web

Requirements (see README.md):
  - at least THREE agents (one coordinator + two or more specialists)
  - at least TWO tools
  - session memory so it handles multi-turn conversations
  - a guardrail or a structured output schema
