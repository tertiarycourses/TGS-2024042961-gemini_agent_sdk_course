# Lab 13 — Load, Split and Embed Documents into a Vector Store

**Topic 03:** Build Agentic AI RAG in Gemini ADK  
**Learning outcome:** LO4 — build the ingestion half of a RAG pipeline and inspect the embeddings.  
**Tools:** ChromaDB, pypdf, google-adk, Gemini embeddings

## Goal

Take two product PDFs, extract their text, split it into retrievable chunks with page metadata, embed them and persist the vectors in a local Chroma database.

## What you'll build

A persistent Chroma collection holding the chunked and embedded air-fryer product and warranty manuals.

## Setup

Run every command from the `labs/` folder (the parent of this one), so that
the shared virtual environment and the single `.env` are picked up.

```bash
cd ..            # into labs/ if you are inside this lab folder
uv sync          # once per machine — installs google-adk and all deps
cp .env.example .env   # once — then paste your GOOGLE_API_KEY into .env
```

Then run this lab with either:

```bash
uv run adk run lab13     # terminal chat
uv run adk web              # browser IDE, then pick lab13 at http://localhost:8000
```

## Step-by-step

1. Inspect the two source PDFs the agent will be grounded in

   ```bash
   ls lab13/*.pdf
   ```

2. Read the extraction function and note the page number kept as metadata

   ```bash
   cat lab13/agent.py
   ```

3. Identify the chunking rule and the minimum chunk length filter
4. Run the agent once to trigger ingestion into ChromaDB

   ```bash
   uv run adk run lab13
   ```

5. Confirm the persistent vector store was created on disk

   ```bash
   ls lab13/chroma_db
   ```

6. Explain why chunks shorter than 50 characters are discarded
7. Change the chunk rule to split on single newlines, delete chroma_db, and re-ingest

   ```bash
   rm -rf lab13/chroma_db
   ```

8. Compare the resulting chunk count and note the effect on retrieval precision

## Test it

lab13/chroma_db exists and contains a populated air_fryer_docs collection, and you can state how the chunking rule changed the number of stored chunks.
