# Lab 3 — Give an Agent Tools — Live Weather and Web Search

**Topic 01:** Overview of Agentic AI in Gemini ADK  
**Learning outcome:** LO1 / LO3 — extend an agent with custom function tools and evaluate tool selection.  
**Tools:** google-adk, OpenWeather API, Tavily API, Gemini 2.0 Flash

## Goal

Add two Python function tools to an agent: a live OpenWeather lookup and a Tavily web search. You see how the docstring and type hints become the tool contract the model reads.

## What you'll build

lab03 — an agent that decides for itself whether a question needs the weather tool, the search tool, both, or neither.

## Setup

Run every command from the `labs/` folder (the parent of this one), so that
the shared virtual environment and the single `.env` are picked up.

```bash
cd ..            # into labs/ if you are inside this lab folder
uv sync          # once per machine — installs google-adk and all deps
cp .env.example .env   # once — then paste your GOOGLE_API_KEY into .env
```

Then run this lab with either:

```bash
uv run adk run lab03     # terminal chat
uv run adk web              # browser IDE, then pick lab03 at http://localhost:8000
```

## Step-by-step

1. Register for a free OpenWeather API key at openweathermap.org and a Tavily key at tavily.com
2. Add both keys to labs/.env as OPENWEATHER_API_KEY and TAVILY_API_KEY
3. Read the two tool functions and note the docstring, the typed arguments and the dict return

   ```bash
   cat lab03/agent.py
   ```

4. Observe that tools are attached with tools=[get_weather, tavily_search]
5. Run the agent

   ```bash
   uv run adk run lab03
   ```

6. Trigger the weather tool

   ```bash
   What is the weather in Singapore right now?
   ```

7. Trigger the search tool

   ```bash
   What are the latest announcements about Google Gemini?
   ```

8. Ask a question needing no tool and confirm none is called

   ```bash
   What is 15 multiplied by 12?
   ```

9. Open adk web and read the function_call and function_response events for each turn

   ```bash
   uv run adk web
   ```


## Test it

The weather question produces a get_weather function_call with a live temperature; the news question produces a tavily_search call; the arithmetic question produces no tool call at all.
