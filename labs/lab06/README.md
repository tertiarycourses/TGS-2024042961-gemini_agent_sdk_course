# Lab 6 — Inspect the Agent Loop — Events, Tool Calls and Final Responses

**Topic 02:** Build A Multi Agent App with Gemini ADK  
**Learning outcome:** LO3 / LO4 — analyse the agent execution loop and evaluate its behaviour.  
**Tools:** google-adk, Runner, Events API, InMemorySessionService

## Goal

Stream the Event objects the Runner emits and learn to read an agent trace: which event carries the tool call, which carries the tool result, and which is the final response.

## What you'll build

lab06 — an instrumented agent that prints every event in its reasoning loop.

## Setup

Run every command from the `labs/` folder (the parent of this one), so that
the shared virtual environment and the single `.env` are picked up.

```bash
cd ..            # into labs/ if you are inside this lab folder
uv sync          # once per machine — installs google-adk and all deps
cp .env.example .env   # once — then paste your GOOGLE_API_KEY into .env
```

Then run this lab with either:

```bash
uv run adk run lab06     # terminal chat
uv run adk web              # browser IDE, then pick lab06 at http://localhost:8000
```

## Step-by-step

1. Read the event-handling loop and find is_final_response()

   ```bash
   cat lab06/agent.py
   ```

2. Run the interaction script

   ```bash
   uv run python lab06/agent.py
   ```

3. Send a prompt that requires a tool

   ```bash
   Find the weather in Singapore and summarise recent AI news.
   ```

4. In the printed trace, identify the function_call event
5. Identify the function_response event carrying the tool's return value
6. Identify the final response event and note how many LLM calls one turn actually took
7. Explain why a two-tool question produces more events than a one-tool question

## Test it

You can point to the function_call, the function_response and the final response in the trace, and state the number of LLM round-trips the turn consumed.
